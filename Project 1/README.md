This programming project consists of two main parts:

UNIX Shell and History Feature

Create a C program that serves as a shell interface on Linux, UNIX, or Mac OS X systems, accepting user commands and executing them in separate processes.
Modify the main() function to fork a child process and execute the user's command.
Parse the user's input into tokens and store them in an array of character strings.
Implement a history feature that allows users to access the most recently entered commands (up to 10) using "!!" for the most recent command, and "!N" for the Nth command in the history.
Manage error handling for cases with no commands in the history or no corresponding command for the entered number.
Linux Kernel Module for Listing Tasks

Write a kernel module that lists all current tasks in a Linux system.
Review the programming project in Chapter 2 on creating Linux kernel modules before starting this project.
Complete the project using the Linux virtual machine provided with the text.
